## 💫 About Me

👩‍🏫 **Former teacher turned developer** – After 7 years in the classroom, I’ve brought my problem-solving, communication, and ability to adapt on the fly.

🛠️ **Currently building** small C# projects that help sharpen my understanding of core programming concepts.

📚 **Learning every day** – I’m filling in the gaps in my C# knowledge through self-identified gaps found during my apprenticeship

🤝 **Always open to ideas** – Whether it’s pair programming, code reviews, or just chatting about tech career switches, I’m here for it.

🎯 **Goal-driven and curious** – I’m not just coding for practice; I’m building the skills for a long-term career in software development.

🎨 **Outside of code** – I love crochet 🧶, gaming 🎮, cross stitch ✂️, and messy play with my children 👶 (especially when it involves glitter or paint everywhere).
